# How to contribute

The files in this repository are used as the starting point for all FEND Udacity students. 
Since this project was completed as part of the program, and not an ongoing endevour, 
I will most likely not accept pull requests. 

Please see the Make Your Own Arcade Game section if you're interested in creating your own.
