# Udacity Front End Nanodegree
## JS Project: Memory Game
This project was completed as part of the [Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to Play
Player must match 8 pairs from 16 cards. To get started, click a card to flip it over. Matched cards will stay flipped over. 
Unmatched cards will turn back over. Although a time clock is running, users may take as long as needed to complete a game. 

### Scoring
The score is based on the number of tries it takes to match all the cards. The maximum number of stars that can be earned is 3. 
As the number of tries increase, the number of stars decrease. 
*  3 Stars = 24 clicks or less 
*  2 Stars = 25-32 clicks or less
*  1 Star = 33 clicks or more
